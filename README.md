##About
Shot-O-Matic is an iPhone app that contains a set of drink recipies (shots)
and some fun ways to find / display said recipies.  This stupid thing was
supposed to make us wildly rich and popular but it turns out that nobody
is willing to pay for apps (especially really dumb ones).  Oh well.

##Current Status:
Broken. New installs from the App Store stopped working somewhere around iOS 8.
Existing copies on devices still work under iOS 9, so it's probably a trivial
fix to get things working again.  If you'd like to take over the official App
Store version, let me know.  Otherwise, feel free to bask in the glory of my
first (and last) iPhone app ever.

##License:
